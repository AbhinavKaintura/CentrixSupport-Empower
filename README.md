## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Python 3
- Flask and other required Python libraries (install via `requirements.txt`)
- React dependencies (install via `package.json`)

### Installation

 **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
    https://github.com/AbhinavKaintura/CentrixSupport-Empower.git
   cd CentrixSupport-Empower
```
This command installs all necessary Python packages for the backend, as listed in the requirements.txt file.
   ```bash
   cd src
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   ```
This command launches the Flask backend server. Once started, the server listens for incoming requests from the frontend and handles them by processing user inputs and generating AI-based responses. The Flask application also connects with the LLM to deliver contextually relevant answers to user queries.
   ```bash
   python flask_main.py
   ```

This command installs all necessary Node.js dependencies for the frontend, as specified in the package.json file
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

This command starts the React development server, allowing you to run and test the chatbot interface in your browser. The frontend connects with the backend Flask server, enabling a seamless user experience as the chatbot processes and responds to user messages in real time.
   ```bash
   npm start
